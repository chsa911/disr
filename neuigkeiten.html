Whats new?</h1>   
<p  >
I am reorganizing my bookshelf to read more and faster so I am 
pretty busy getting rid of my books as you 
might have discovered on my youtube channel.

Its done I could reorganize my bookshelf
<img src="/assets/images/bookshelf_reorganisation.jpeg" width="20%" height="300" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
You can can see that only a small compartment is filled with books to read and the rest is full of new books to be prepared. 
So it helps me to focus on a few books and to enjoy more and select and dispose of faster..
